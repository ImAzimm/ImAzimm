## 🧩 My expectation as a Software Maintenance Student

In the world of software, development doesn’t end when a program runs — it truly begins when people start using it.  
As a **Software Maintenance student**, I see myself as someone who ensures systems stay **reliable, adaptable, and long-lasting**.

Through this course, I aim to:
1. Understand how to **analyze and improve existing systems**
2. Strengthen my ability to **read, refactor, and debug legacy code**
3. Learn how to **apply software evolution principles** in real-world projects  
4. Master tools like **Git**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **testing frameworks** for effective change management  
5. Develop the **discipline and mindset** needed to maintain clean, efficient, and sustainable software  

💬 *I believe maintenance is where real engineering begins — where understanding, patience, and precision come together to keep software alive.*
